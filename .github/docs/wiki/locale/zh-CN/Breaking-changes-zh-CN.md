# Breaking changes

## 2023-09-25

The `SERVER_HOST` and `SERVER_PORT` environment variables have been renamed to `APP_HOST` and `APP_PORT` respectively.

## 2023-09-21

The minimum Python version has been changed to 3.11.

## 2023-07-19

The behaviour of overall pp and accuracy has changed to encapsulate all of a user's scores rather than their top 100, in order to match Bancho's behaviour. This means a recalculation of user's stats is necessary. bancho.py has a recalculation tool which can be found in `tools/recalc.py` in order to facilitate this.

## 2023-04-09

The `MIRROR_URL` environment variable has been split into `MIRROR_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` and `MIRROR_DOWNLOAD_ENDPOINT`.

```diff
-MIRROR_URL=https://api.chimu.moe/v1
